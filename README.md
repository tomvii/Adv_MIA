# Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in MIA
A curated list of papers concerning Adversarial Medical Image Analysis (AdvMIA).

### Survey
Survey on Adversarial Attack and Defense for Medical Image Analysis: Methods and Challenges

**October 2024**: ðŸ’¡The survey is now accepted by <em>ACM Computing Surveys</em>.

**March 2023**: We release the initial version of our survey paper by summarizing the current state of the AdvMIA methods with a unified benchmark evaluation of adversarial robustness for medical image analysis [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14133)

### Code
The code regarding adversarial defenses (adversarial training) for medical image analysis will be released soon.
